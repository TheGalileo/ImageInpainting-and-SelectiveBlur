# ImageInpainting-and-SelectiveBlur
This was done as a part of the coursework for EE604A (Image Processing) at IIT Kanpur.  
MATLAB implementation of the inpainting algorithm as proposed by Criminisi et al. in 2004, and that of selective motion blur.

# How to Run
## Requirements:
The Inpainting algorithm will work (and has been tested) on MATLAB 2015b and MATLAB 2017a. It shouldn't be a problem to get it running on the versions that came in between these two (and the ones that are about to come).  
The selective motion blur will work only on MATLAB 2017a (and beyond) as it makes use of Lazy Snapping, which was introduced very recently.

## Steps:
